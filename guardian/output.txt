Abbott said the reforms needed to be dropped to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/05/race-discrimination-commissioner-backs-tony-abbotts-race-law-decision\" class=\"u-underline\">preserve &#x201C;national unity</a>&#x201D; as the government planned wider security legislation in response to the global terrorism threat. </p>\n<p>Bernardi, a Liberal senator who has been a regular critic of the Turnbull leadership, said section 18c of the RDA needed to change because it was &#x201C;Orwellian&#x201D;. <br></p>\n<p>&#x201C;While some want to abolish [18C] in its entirety, a good start would be to remove the words &#x2018;offend&#x2019; and &#x2018;insult&#x2019; from the act,&#x201D; Bernardi wrote in his weekly newsletter.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This has even drawn strong support from across the political divide. In the last parliament a bill to this effect (which I co-sponsored) was introduced but was never voted upon.<br></p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s time for that to change. In the first week back in parliament I&#x2019;ll be reintroducing the same bill with the expectation that this parliament will finally get a vote and expose very clearly who among your elected representatives is interested in protecting our freedoms and way of life.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It will also indicate those who have been captured by and surrendered to Orwell&#x2019;s frightening vision characterised in his book Nineteen Eighty-Four.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The assistant agriculture minister Anne Ruston agreed in her weekly newsletter that &#x201C;some of the words in this section should probably go, at least&#x201D;.<br></p>\n<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Offend&#x2019;, &#x2018;insult&#x2019;, and &#x2018;humiliate&#x2019; are highly subjective terms open to all manner of interpretations. Laws governing our behaviour towards others should be objective in their working as possible.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The comments come after senator James Patterson said on Monday the senate was only &#x201C;one or two votes away&#x201D; from a passing a bill to remove &#x201C;offend&#x201D; and &#x201C;insult&#x201D; from the section 18c of the Racial Discrimination Act. </p>\n<p>A number of Liberal sources told Guardian Australia that if a bill to remove the words &#x201C;insult&#x201D; and &#x201C;offend&#x201D; were put to the Coalition partyroom, it would win majority support. The Bernardi bill will present a challenge for the Coalition, which will have to decide whether to allow the bill to go to the floor of the senate for debate. </p>\n<p>The attorney general, George Brandis, who when selling the original reforms said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/24/george-brandis-people-have-the-right-to-be-bigots\" class=\"u-underline\">everyone had the right to be a bigot</a>, has since consistently said that any change is off the table. </p>\n<p>The issue is building again for a number of reasons. The election of One Nation senators who support the change has emboldened Coalition senators in favour of changing the act. </p>\n<p>And senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/david-leyonhjelm\" class=\"u-underline\">David Leyonhjelm</a> has launched a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/15/david-leyonhjelm-racial-discrimination-complaint-angry-white-male-fairfax-18c\" class=\"u-underline\">discrimination complaint</a> over an opinion article describing him as an &#x201C;angry white male&#x201D;, saying it shows why the race speech law is absurd and needs to be repealed.</p>\n<p>While One Nation&#x2019;s four senators would support any bill to water down 18C, Nick Xenophon, who has three votes in the senate, is against any attempts. Of the remaining senators, Derryn Hinch of the Justice Party and Bob Day of Family First support the changes, while Jacqui Lambie is against. </p>\n<p> Bill Shorten has called on Turnbull to confirm whether he did a deal with the right wing of the party to change 18c, after an <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/racial-discrimination-act--malcolm-turnbull-promised-18c-changes-ahead-of-tony-abbott-spill/news-story/122263f1da4583a9cb5506a08a6eb45e\" class=\"u-underline\">unsourced report</a> in the Daily Telegraph. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;Did Mr Turnbull do a deal with his own right wing to undermine protections against hate speech or not? &#x201C; Shorten said. <br></p>\n<p>The prime minister&#x2019;s office had no comment.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

We expect it to rise further in the next few years, as fiscal consolidation proves challenging.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In this background, we forecast government debt to rise to close to 41% of GDP by fiscal 2017 and to just under 45% by the end of the decade.<br>&#x201C;However, Australia&#x2019;s debt burden will remain consistent with a AAA rating, albeit rising and no longer low. For instance, the debt burden will be lower than some other AAA-rated sovereigns such as Canada or the Netherlands and not significantly higher than Sweden&#x2019;s or Denmark&#x2019;s (all AAA stable).&#x201D;</p>\n<p>It also pointed out that, at 36.1% of GDP in the year ending in June 2015, Australia&#x2019;s general government debt was somewhat lower than the 38.1% median level of AAA-rated sovereigns.</p>\n<p>Morrison said the credit rating underlined how important Australia&#x2019;s banks were to the country&#x2019;s economic stability, and he warned they were not fair game for politicians.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t go and play politics with that,&#x201D; Morrison said, a reference to Labor&#x2019;s calls for a banking royal commission.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t go messing around with the banking and financial system to make cheap political points.&#x201D;<br></p>\n<p>It was incumbent on the opposition to support the government&#x2019;s budget measures to reduce the deficit, he said, and therefore keep the AAA rating.</p>\n<p>The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, made a similar point on Wednesday during his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/16/malcolm-turnbull-demands-support-from-opposition-for-savings-measures\" class=\"u-underline\">first major economic address</a> since the election, urging his political opponents to pass Coalition policies for the good of the economy. &#x201C;This is not, and should not be, about ideology,&#x201D; he said in a speech in Melbourne.</p>\n<p>He also revealed plans to introduce an omnibus bill that would pull together the savings measures that Labor said it would support during the election campaign, worth more than $6bn.<br></p>\n<p>The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said Turnbull had not discussed that plan with Labor before announcing it, so he would like to look at the bill before he supported it in parliament.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is a stunt by Malcolm Turnbull to distract from his own internal problems,&#x201D; Bowen said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I mean, he is lecturing the Labor party about the need for budget repair, [but] he can&#x2019;t even get his own party to vote for superannuation reforms.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Moody&#x2019;s assessment followed a similar decision by Fitch Ratings last month to affirm Australia&#x2019;s triple-A credit rating with a stable outlook.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
